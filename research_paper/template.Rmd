# How to interpret your grade

This document summarizes your grade on the final research paper before considering any possible late penalties. Your final grade will consist of this grade, less any late penalties that apply.

Your grade before penalties on a scale of 0-100 is in the section, *Overall grade before any late penalties*.

It is calculated as follows: You've been given up to 10 points on each of 5 categories: policy analysis, political analysis, democracy analysis, research quality, and writing quality. The categories are weighted as follows:

-   Policy, political, and democracy analysis combined are worth `r label_percent()(params$ppd_pct)` (each is worth one-third of that, or approximately  `r label_percent(accuracy=.1)(params$ppd_pct / 3)`).
-   Research quality is weighted `r label_percent()(params$research_pct)`
-   Writing quality is weighted `r label_percent()(params$writing_pct)`

The weighted sum of your points, multiplied by 10, is your overall grade on a 0-100 scale.

# Bill number and short description

`r paste0(params$billnum, ": ", params$billdesc, ".  ")`

# Overall grade before any late penalties

`r paste0("Grade: ", params$gradebase, ".\n")`
`r if(!is.na(params$comments)) params$comments`

# Policy analysis

`r paste0("Points: ", params$policy_numeric, " of 10 possible.\n")`
`r params$policy`

# Political analysis

`r paste0("Points: ", params$politics_numeric, " of 10 possible.\n")`
`r params$politics`

# Democracy analysis

`r paste0("Points: ", params$democracy_numeric, " of 10 possible.\n")`
`r params$democracy`

# Research quality

`r paste0("Points: ", params$research_numeric, " of 10 possible.\n")`
`r params$research`

# Writing quality

`r paste0("Points: ", params$writing_numeric, " of 10 possible.\n")`
`r params$writing`
