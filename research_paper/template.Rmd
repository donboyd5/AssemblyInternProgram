# How to interpret your grade

This document summarizes your grade on the final research paper before considering any possible late penalties. Your final grade will consist of this grade, less any late penalties that apply.

Your grade before penalties on a scale of 0-100 is in the section, *Overall grade before any late penalties*.

It is calculated as follows: You've been given up to 10 points on each of 5 categories: policy analysis, political analysis, democracy analysis, research quality, and writing quality. The categories are weighted as follows:

-   Policy, political, and democracy analysis combined are worth 70% (each is worth one-third of that, or approximately 23.3%).
-   Research quality is weighted 20%
-   Writing quality is weighted 10%

The weighted sum of your points, multiplied by 10, is your overall grade on a 0-100 scale.

# Overall grade before any late penalties

# Policy analysis (23.33%)

# Democracy analysis (23.33%)

`r paste0("Points: ", params$democracy_numeric, " of 10 possible.\n")`

# Research quality (20%)

`r paste0("Points: ", params$research_numeric, " of 10 possible.\n")`
`r params$research`

# Writing quality (10%)

`r paste0("Points: ", params$writing_numeric, " of 10 possible.\n")`
