-   Get advice or information from a busy expert who:
    -   ordinarily might not respond to you
    -   might even be wary - legislative staff can be scary
-   Get them to respond, and be helpful

CAUTION: This is hard work

## Principles

-   Respect them and their expertise

-   Respect their time

-   Be precise. Reduce uncertainty.

-   People appreciate this:

    -   It can be flattering to be asked for advice

    -   It can be enjoyable to be asked an interesting question
    
    -   It's no fun to be asked vague questions
    
    -   It's no fun to be stuck on a phone call with no end in sight

## Don't{.r-fit-text}

-   ...ask a question so broad that answers fill libraries

<DL>
<DD>
***hey, is there any research on homelessness?*** <!-- <br/><br/> -->
<DD>
um...have you heard of Google?
</DL>

-   ...ask a question you didn't try to answer on your own
<DL>
<DD>
***hey, why does New York have such high homelessness, yet very low rates of unsheltered homelessness?***
<DD>
um...did you even look at my web page?
</DL>

-   ...ignore what made them an expert in the first place

<DL>
<DD>
***hey Sally, I heard you know about education; can we talk?***
<DD>
um...I'm Dr. Robinson; I've been researching education for 15 years. Did you have a question?

## Do's

Show you've done your homework

## How to write an email

-   Think carefully about every major element:

    -   Subject
    -   Salutation
    -   Opening paragraph
    -   Middle text
    -   Closing paragraph
    -   Signoff
    -   Your signature block
    -   Any post-signoff information

# General email tips

-   Keep email visually short and nonthreatening

-   Be polite and correct. Write like a grownup

-   Subject: say what you want, drop names where appropriate

-   Salutation: err on side of formality until indicated otherwise

-   Opening: say concisely and precisely what you want

-   Middle: show you did homework but don't be verbose; push details to post-signoff

-   Signoff: anything appropriate

-   Signature block: name, title, office, contact info

-   Post sign-off: important substantive details too long for middle

## Subject lines

-   Horrible subject lines

    -   

    -   hi

    -   FWD:

    -   can we talk

-   Better subject lines

    -   Seeking advice and 10 min phone call re your research on homelessness

    -   Assemblymember Johnson seeks your advice on education
