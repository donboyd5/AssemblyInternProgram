## The Situation

-   You need to get advice from an expert on an issue - by phone call or email

-   The expert doesn't know you

-   You have low status (lower than the expert)


<!-- -   Get advice or information from a busy expert who: -->
<!--     -   ordinarily might not respond to you -->
<!--     -   might even be wary - legislative staff can be scary -->
<!-- -   Get them to respond, and be helpful -->

<!-- CAUTION: This is hard work -->

## Principles{.smaller}

-   Respect them and their expertise

-   Respect their time

-   Be precise. Reduce uncertainty. They may be concerned.

-   People appreciate this:

    -   It can be flattering to be asked for advice

    -   It can be enjoyable to be asked an interesting question
    
-   People don't like:    
    
    -   Being asked vague or ill-informed questions
    
    -   Being stuck on a phone call with no end in sight


## Classic mistakes. Don't: {.smaller}

-   ...ask a question so broad that the answer could go on forever

<DL>
<DD>
***hey, is there any research on homelessness?*** <!-- <br/><br/> -->
<DD>
um...have you heard of Google?
</DL>

-   ...ask a question you didn't try to answer on your own

<DL>
<DD>
***hey, why does New York have high homelessness yet low rates of unsheltered homelessness?***
<DD>
um...did you even look at my web page? I wrote a paper on this...
</DL>

-   ...ignore what made them an expert in the first place

<DL>
<DD>
***hey Sally, I heard you know about education; can we talk?***
<DD>
um...I'm Dr. Robinson; I've been researching education for 15 years. Did you have a question?

-   Signature block: name, title, office, contact info

-   Post sign-off: important substantive details too long for middle
