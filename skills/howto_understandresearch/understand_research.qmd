## Issue

-   "Science" is not a set of facts or conclusions, it's a process

-   As researchers learn, they change their conclusions

-   Researchers are people, too, with biases, flaws, egos

-   There is a reproducibility crisis in much of academia

-   Research users often are not skilled in describing the state of research, and have their own biases

-   How can you write a memo saying what "the science" is, or whether research supports a particular policy?
