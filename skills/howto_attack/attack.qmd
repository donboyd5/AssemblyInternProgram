## How will they attack you? {.smaller}

-   Fair attacks

    -   Intended consequences - your proposal "harmed" people you intended to affect, in ways you intended; your proposal; costs a lot; they don't like it

    -   Unintended consequences - e.g., your proposal harms someone that is an innocent bystander; or perhaps it has big loopholes that make it expensive

-   Unfair attacks

    -   Saying your proposal does things it does not do

    -   Identifying and focusing on the edge cases - highly sympathetic parties who barely exist (few of them)

    -   Focusing on technical errors that appear to make it do something you don't intend

## How can you prepare? {.smaller}

-   Understand your proposal, in detail. Understand its complexity.

-   Understand the distributional consequences of your proposal: income, industries, geography; for some kinds of proposals, race and ethnicity, gender, age

-   Are there parties you neglected to help who are similar to those you help? Are there parties harmed unintentionally?

-   Get others to examine the proposal in detail; it's amazing what others can find when they give it a fresh read

-   Understand, deeply, the arguments of your critics. Are any fair? Why do they say what they say? Are their facts correct?

-   Review criticisms elsewhere - other states, other times, etc.

-   Techniques - Q&A, briefing documents

-   Knowledge and preparation are key
