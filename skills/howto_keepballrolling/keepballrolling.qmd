## Issue

-	Other people often won't do what you want, when you want. (Whuy should they?)

-	Sometimes we allow this to slow us down:

	-	We wait for someone to get back to us before we take the next step

	-	We ask two people the same question, and they both assume the other will answer

	-	We don't have a plan for what to do if critical information does not come our way

-	There are techniques we can use to minimize dead-in-the-water time

## Avoid the problem in the first place

-	Never, *ever*, ask two people the same question without making clear who you want to answer it, and when

-	Never leave unclear when you need to know, or what will happen if they don't respond by then.

	BAD: "Hey guys, I'd love your feedback on the attached bill memo for Assemblyperson X, whaddayathink?"

	BETTER: "Hi Emily, I'm going to send a bill memo to Assemblyperson X on Thursday right after noon. I've attached d really love to take into account any comments you have. get your comments would like your opinion on this. (I'm copying Steve so he's in the loop. Steve I welcome any thoughts you have on this.)

-	You'll be surprised at how assertive you can be about these things without ruffling feathers. (Sometimes you will.)

## Make clear what you'll do next
