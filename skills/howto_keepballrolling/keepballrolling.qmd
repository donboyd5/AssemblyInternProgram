## Issue

-	Other people often won't do what you want, when you want. (Whuy should they?)

-	Sometimes we allow this to slow us down:

	-	We wait for someone to get back to us before we take the next step

	-	We ask two people the same question, and they both assume the other will answer

	-	We don't have a plan for what to do if critical information does not come our way

-	There are techniques we can use to minimize dead-in-the-water time

## Avoid the problem in the first place

-	Never, *ever*, ask two people the same question without making clear who you want to answer it, and when

-	Never leave unclear when you need to know, or what will happen if they don't respond by then.

Steve I welcome any thoughts you have on this.)

-	You'll be surprised at how assertive you can be about these things without ruffling feathers. (Sometimes you will.)

## Make clear what you'll do next
