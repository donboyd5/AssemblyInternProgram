## The Situation

-   You need or want information or action by others to complete what you're doing. Examples:

    -   You want comments on a memo you're writing

    -   You need them to send you a couple of paragraphs

    -   You think they need to approve before you send something on to others

-   They're not responding, or not on the time frame you need

-   They don't work for you; you have no direct authority

## Issue

-   Other people often won't do what you want, when you want. (Why should they?)

-   Sometimes we allow this to slow us down:

    -   We wait for someone to get back to us before we take the next step

    -   We ask two people the same question, and they both assume the other will answer

    -   We don't have a plan for what to do if critical information does not come our way

-   There are techniques we can use to minimize dead-in-the-water time

## Avoid the problem in the first place

-   Never, *ever*, ask two people the same question without making clear who you want to answer it, and when

-   Never leave unclear when you need to know

-   Never leave unclear what will happen if they don't respond by then

-   Enlist help, or implied help, where appropriate

You'll be surprised at how assertive you can be about these things without ruffling feathers. (Sometimes you will.)

## Assign responsibility or priority when asking multiple people

***BAD:*** "Hey Emily and Steve, I'd love your feedback on the attached bill memo for Assemblyperson X, can you give me your thoughts?"

***BETTER:*** "Hi Emily, I'm going to send a bill memo to Assemblyperson X on Thursday right after noon. I've attached a draft. I'd really love to take into account any comments you have. (I'm copying Steve so he's in the loop. Steve I welcome any thoughts you have on this.)"

**DON'T:** Ask people who work together the same question without making them aware of it.

## Be precise about deadlines (or time frames)

-   *I need to give this to Assemblymember X by noon on Monday*

-   *I would appreciate your comments by Friday end of day, so that I can reflect them.*

-   Not - *Hey guys, could you get back to me on this in the next few days?*

## Be clear about what will happen next - leave yourself a path {.smaller}

-   Not: *I'd like to have your comments before I send this along - could you please try to get back to me in a day or two?*

-   Better: *As I mentioned, I need to send this to Assemblymember X on Monday - I don't have control over that. Since you weren't able to get back to me I'll plan to send it along with placeholders for your sections.* (One last chance.) Direct phone calls can clear the air, of course.

-   Many (not all!) bosses appreciate it when you make it clear (politely) what you'll do if *they* don't get back to you. So often, this is ok:

    -   We've had clear discussions about your priorities here, so if you don't have a chance to provide comments by Tuesday I'll plan to move this on to person Y as a draft on Wednesday for comments, and circle back with you after that.

-   But don't do this unless you have a clear sense that it is indeed consistent with the busy boss's wishes - a direct conversation about whether this general approach will work for them is a good idea. It is a good way to be efficient, and further your boss's goals - but not if they want to stay on top of every single step.

## Enlist help of others, possibly the Big Boss

-   Sometimes asking others for help with a slow responder can get that person to be quicker

-   Sometimes mentioning to the slow responder that you'll ask for help is all you need to do
