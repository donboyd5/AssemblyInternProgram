-   You need to create a profile of your Assembly District

-   Demographics - age, sex, race & ethnicity

-   Economy - industries, occupations, incomes, travel to work

-   Perhaps other information - geographic characteristics

-   Compare to other disticts, and to itself over time

## Data you need to know even if you're not a nerd

-   [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) - U.S. Census Bureau, 1% and 5% samples of the population (e.g., 330 million people x \~5% \~ 16 million people asked detailed questions!)

    -   

-   Be precise. Reduce uncertainty.

-   People appreciate this:

    -   It can be flattering to be asked for advice

    -   It can be enjoyable to be asked an interesting question

    -   It's no fun to be asked vague questions

    -   It's no fun to be stuck on a phone call with no end in sight
