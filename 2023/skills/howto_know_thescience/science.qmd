## Situation

-   You need to learn what "The Science" says about an issue

    -   *Does the minimum wage lead to higher unemployment?*

    -   *Do smaller class sizes lead to better student outcomes?*

-   You are not an expert in the area

## Often hard to determine when policies are successful

-   Does "policy A cause outcome B"? *Correlation is not causation*

    -   Do smaller class sizes lead to better student learning?

    -   Or do deeply involved parents

        -   provide extra education at home, *AND ALSO*

        -   push for their children to be in smaller classes?

-   Challenging to do randomized studies of public policies

## Conclusions can differ across studies

-   Data and methods improve. Different data/methods may yield different conclusions.

-   *Causal* methods require specialized training to understand.

-   [Arnold Ventures: replication research](https://www.arnoldventures.org/stories/important-lessons-about-reproducibility-in-science) \< 1/2 of 100 psychology studies were replicated. Similar problems other fields.

-   Researchers, like other people, have biases, flaws.

-   Generally best not to rely on a single study.

## What can you do?

-   Find top-notch literature review. (A paper, or section of a paper, that reviews what researchers have concluded about a topic.) They vary in quality.

-   Find think tanks & research orgs with reviews in everyday language

-   Find an expert who knows the field and ask them good questions

-   Probably not a good use of time to do your own lit review

## Finding a literature review

-   Search topic databases or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/): e.g., "impact of minimum wage on employment AND literature review" or "...AND meta-analysis". EBSCO and ProQuest allow you to limit search to review articles only.

-   Search a journal that specializes in literature reviews in the field of interest (e.g., *Journal of Economic Literature*)

-   Examine prominent recent papers for literature review - typically an early section

-   Smart, careful, ethical use of AI technology - e.g., , [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [elicit](https://elicit.org/), maybe [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/); rapidly changing field

## Think tanks and policy analysis research groups

-   Some think tanks do excellent literature reviews. Many have strong policy leanings, so be careful.

-   There are well-known groups associated with most important public policy issues.

-   [Harvard has a good search engine](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/hks/think_tank_search). Searching "minimum wage AND literature review" will pull up several literature reviews.

## Finding experts and asking questions

-   How do you summarize the research on this topic?

-   How much controversy or disagreement would you say there is among prominent researchers? Why?

-   How do you assess the research, and why?

-   Who would be a good person to give me the other side?

-   Who funds your research?

## Remember, with research and advocacy...
