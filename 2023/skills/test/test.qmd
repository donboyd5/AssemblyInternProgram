## Goals

-   Get advice or information from a busy expert who:
    -   ordinarily might not respond to you
    -   might even be wary - legislative staff can be scary
-   Get them to respond, and be helpful

CAUTION: This is hard work

## General email tips

-   Keep email visually short and nonthreatening

    -   If you must include details, put them after signature block

-   Be polite and correct. Write like a grownup

<!-- {.smaller} -->

## Email elements 

-   Subject: say what you want, drop names where appropriate

-   Salutation: err on side of formality until indicated otherwise

-   Opening: say concisely and precisely what you want

-   Middle: show you did homework but don't be verbose; push details to post-signoff

-   Signoff: anything appropriate

-   Signature block: name, title, office, contact info

-   Post sign-off: important substantive details too long for middle
