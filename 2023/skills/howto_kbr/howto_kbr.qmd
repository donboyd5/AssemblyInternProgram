## The Situation {.smaller}

-   You need or want information or action by others to complete what you're doing. Examples:

    -   You want comments on a memo you're writing

    -   You need them to send you a couple of paragraphs

    -   You think they need to approve before you send something on to others

-   They're not responding, or not on the time frame you need

-   They don't work for you; you have no direct authority

## Issue {.smaller}

-   Other people often won't do what you want, when you want. (Why should they?)

-   Sometimes we allow this to slow us down:

    -   We wait for someone to get back to us before we take the next step

    -   We ask two people the same question, and they both assume the other will answer

    -   We don't have a plan for what to do if critical information does not come our way

-   There are techniques we can use to minimize dead-in-the-water time

## Avoid the problem in the first place

-   Never, *ever*, ask two people the same question without making clear who you want to answer it, and when

-   Never leave unclear when you need to know

-   Never leave unclear what will happen if they don't respond by then

-   Enlist help, or implied help, where appropriate

You'll be surprised at how assertive you can be about these things without ruffling feathers. (Sometimes you will.)

## Make it easy for people to respond

-   Attach documents

-   Given links

-   Highlight areas on which you want feedback

-   Include excerpts in your email that you want comments on

## Assign responsibility or priority when asking multiple people {.smaller}

***BAD:*** "Hey Emily and Steve, I'd love your feedback on the attached bill memo for Assemblyperson X, can you give me your thoughts?"

***BETTER:*** "Hi Emily, I'm going to send a bill memo to Assemblyperson X on Thursday right after noon. I've attached a draft. I'd really love to take into account any comments you have. (I'm copying Steve so he's in the loop. Steve I welcome any thoughts you have on this.)"

**DON'T:** Ask people who work together the same question without making them aware of it.

## Be precise about deadlines (or time frames)

-   *I need to give this to Assemblymember X by noon on Monday*

-   *I would appreciate your comments by Friday end of day, so that I can reflect them.*

-   Not - *Hey guys, could you get back to me on this in the next few days?*

## Be clear about what will happen next {.smaller}

-   Not: *I'd like your comments before I send this along - could you try to get back to me in a day or two?*

-   Better: *I need to send this to Assemblymember X on Monday - I can't control that. If that's too soon, I'll leave placeholders for your sections.* (One last chance.) Direct phone calls can clear the air.

-   Many (not all!) bosses appreciate clear (polite) info on what you'll do if *they* don't get back to you:

    -   I understand your priorities here; if you can't comment by Tuesday I'll move this to person Y as draft and circle back with you.

-   Don't do this without being sure it's consistent with the busy boss's wishes - a direct conversation is a good idea.

## Enlist help of others, possibly the Big Boss

-   Consider asking others for help with a slow responder

-   Tell the slow responder that you'll ask for help
