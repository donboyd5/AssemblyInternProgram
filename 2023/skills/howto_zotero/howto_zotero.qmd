## The Situation {.smaller}

-   You're working on a project that requires you to access many documents:

    -   The text of bills
    -   Bill memos
    -   Web articles
    -   Reports
    -   Maybe even an academic paper or two

-   You need a way to keep it all organized and handy - to find documents **and search within them**.

-   You might have to write a memo and will want to cite sources.

-   You may need to **share documents** with people in other locations.

## Zotero setup

-   <a href="clips/open_account.mp4" target="_blank">Open a free Zotero account</a>

-   <a href="clips/download_install.mp4" target="_blank">Download and install PC software</a>

-   <a href="clips/setup_sync.mp4" target="_blank">Set up PC software for syncing</a>

-   Also, a good idea to get the [extension for your browser](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) to make saving files easy (no video)

-   There is also a [Word plug-in](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_installation) to make citation easier that should be installed automatically (no video)

## Start a research project

-   <a href="clips/start_research_project.mp4" target="_blank">Create a collection and maybe some subcollections</a>

-   <a href="clips/add_documents.mp4" target="_blank">Extended clip showing ways to download files</a>

-   <a href="clips/what_you_can_do.mp4" target="_blank">Extended clip showing some things you can do</a>

## Parting comments {.smaller}

-   You don't need to be writing academic papers or school papers to benefit from bibliographic software.

-   It can be very helpful in any project in which you have to keep track of large numbers of documents, find them easily, and **search within them**.

-   This is especially true if you will be citing documents.

-   And especially true if you are **working with colleagues** in different locations who need access to the same documents.

-   Zotero is my tool of choice for this, and it is free unless you have a LOT of documents. Other tools include Endnote and Mendeley. I haven't used them. There are a lot of comparisons on the web.
