## The Situation

-   You need to get advice from an expert, by phone or email

-   The expert doesn't know you

-   You have low status in their world (they don't have to respond)

## Principles and concerns {.smaller}

-   Respect them and their expertise

-   Respect their time

-   Be precise. Reduce uncertainty. They may be concerned.

-   It can be flattering to be asked for advice or asked an interesting question

-   It's not enjoyable to be asked vague questions or be stuck on a neverending phone call

## Classic mistakes. Don't: {.smaller}

-   ...ask a question that demonstrates you didn't do any preliminary investigation

<DL>

<DD>

**hey, is there any research on homelessness?** <!-- <br/><br/> -->

<DD>

<p style="color:blue;">

*um...have you heard of Google?*

</p>

</DL>

-   ...ask a question that demonstrates you didn't investigate their expertise

<DL>

<DD>

**hey, why does New York have high homelessness yet low rates of unsheltered homelessness?**

<DD>

<p style="color:blue;">

*um...did you look at my web page? I wrote a paper on this...*

</p>

</DL>

-   ...ignore what made them an expert in the first place

<DL>

<DD>

**hey Sally, I heard you know about education; can we talk?**

<DD>

<p style="color:blue;">

*um...I'm Dr. Robinson; I've been researching education for 15 years. Did you have a question?*

</p>

</DL>

## Do's {.smaller}

Before you reach out:

-   Do your homework where practical. Where not, explain.

When you reach out:

-   Show that you've done your homework

-   Ask precise questions

CAUTION: This is hard work.

## Techniques {.smaller}

-   Raise your status: "Assemblymember X asked me to reach out to you", or get someone they know to connect you.
-   Make your request easy to understand: Short, direct email with a clear request.
-   Make response easy: Send precise on-point questions in advance. That allows a partial response by email.
-   Allay concerns. They may have a busy schedule: Offer to set a time limit and stick to it. They may be afraid of the legislature (name in the press, etc.).
-   Don't accept failure: Always follow up, even to nonresponse. Ask for other people to talk to if they're too busy

## How to write an email {.smaller}

-   Think carefully about every major element:

    -   Subject
    -   Salutation
    -   Opening paragraph
    -   Middle text
    -   Closing paragraph
    -   Signoff
    -   Your signature block
    -   Any post-signoff information

## General email tips {.smaller}

-   Draft the email in a separate doc, copy into email when it says what you want.

-   Keep email visually short and nonintimidating.

-   Be polite and correct. Use proper sentences.

-   Subject: say what you want, drop names where appropriate

-   Salutation: err on side of formality until indicated otherwise

-   Opening: say concisely and precisely what you want

-   Middle: show you did homework but don't be verbose; push details to post-signoff

-   Signoff: establish clear next steps about what you want to happen

-   Signature block: name, title, office, contact info

-   Post sign-off: important substantive details too long for middle. Make them non-intimidating.

## Subject lines {.smaller}

-   Horrible subject lines

    -   

    -   hi

    -   FWD:

    -   can we talk

-   Better subject lines

    -   Seeking advice and 10 min phone call re your research on homelessness

    -   Assemblymember Johnson seeks your advice on education

## Salutation and opening {.smaller}

-   Salutation: If they have a title, use it (e.g., Honorable, Mayor, Dr.); if not, consider "Mr.", "Ms." etc. rather than first names. Not "Hey", or "Julie" or other abrupt starts. Styles do change with time and age, of course. Still, I recommend erring on the side of formality.

-   Opening. Short and sweet, often a freestanding paragraph is good. Who are you and what do you want? For example:

> Dear Dr. Johnson,
>
> I am a research assistant to Assemblymember X. She is deeply interested in introducing legislation to address issue A. I understand from preliminary investigation that you have done research on how policies to address this have worked in other states. I was hoping I could have a brief phone call with you this week or next to get some advice.

## Middle {.smaller}

-   Show you've done your homework. Make the area of inquiry clear. Be brief. Push details to post-signoff. For example:

> We're particularly interested in how to structure the policy in New York, given that our population is older than the typical state \[pop age is just an example\]. I read your paper \[title\] and while I understood how most of it would be relevant to New York, it would be valuable to me to talk about it. In addition, I have a few specific questions, which you'll find after my signoff.

## Signoff {.smaller}

-   Be clear about what you want to happen next. Minimize need for back and forth communication to set a date/time by offering specific times.

> Would you have time for a call on Friday of this week, or possibly Monday or Tuesday of next? I will move things as needed to do any time that works for you, other than 9:30-10 am on Monday and 1-2 pm on Tuesday. I know you're busy and I will keep the call as short as you want - even a 10-minute call would be valuable. If you have a specific time limit, if you let me know I will honor it.

## Signature block post-signoff information {.smaller}

-   Be sure signature block lists your office, title, and contact information.

> Alex Smith, Intern\
> Assemblymember Johnson, ...\
> email\
> phone

-   Put any detailed questions you have, or other information you think the person should have, after your signature block. Use headers and spacing to make it easy to read.

## Follow up

-   People will feel guilty about not responding, but not necessarily so guilty that they'll respond.
-   Follow up mercilessly, getting up to but not over the line between persistent and pest. If you haven't heard back after the right amount of time (2 days?) send a follow-up email; don't wait for the trail to get cold.
