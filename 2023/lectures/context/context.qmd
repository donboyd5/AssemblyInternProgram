## Budget update

Timely budget?

## Context affects policymaking {.smaller}

State policymaking is influenced by many contextual factors, such as:

-   Constitutions and laws

-   Powers of the branches of government

-   Institutional structure of government

-   Interest groups

Goals:

-   Understand several major ways in which context can affect NY policymaking

-   Learn of resources that can help you teach yourself more

# The budgetary context

## The Governor - many responsibilities and powers {.smaller}

-   **Executive power**: chief executive, enforce laws, oversee administration

-   **Budget**: prepare and submit annual budget to legislature, manage state finances

-   **Legislative leadership**: work with the legislature to pass laws & set policy

-   **Appointments**: appoint judges, department heads, commission heads, other officials.

-   **Veto power**: veto or approve bills passed by the legislature

-   **Emergency management**: preparation, response, coordination; emergency powers

-   **Pardons and commutations**: power wrt individuals convicted of crimes

## What makes a governor powerful? {.smaller}

Ferguson 2013 (optional reading): Governors have different powers in different venues (executive, legislative, national). Important elements of power:

-   **Personal power (specific to the person)** - from factors such as electoral mandate, support network as they progressed through political system, future prospects (e.g., lame duck may have low power), perceived performance (polls, ratings), force of personality.

-   **Institutional power (specific to the office and political environment)** - constitutions & statutes determine, *among other things*, (1) sharing of executive power with other statewide officials, (2) potential tenure time in office, (3) appointment powers (management and horse-trading), (4) budget power, and (5) veto power; political context may provide (6) party control or other political power.

Political scientists try to quantify these factors, but it is not easy. Ferguson's Table 8-4 suggests that in \~2015 the New York governor had slightly above-average institutional power, held back by weak budget power (!) and weak party control.

## Power of the New York governor (1) {.smaller}

-   Many seasoned observers conclude NY governor has remarkably **STRONG** budget powers, established/affirmed over decades via judicial constitutional interpretations:

    -   Dr. Penksa discussed this in the budget session. *Silver v. Pataki* and *Bankers' Association* were key decisions.

    -   Benjamin & Benjamin (required reading), argue that NY governor's *institutional* powers are among strongest in the nation (citing older research)

    -   Edward McKinley (required reading - *TU*) - argued (hyperbolically?) that Andrew Cuomo might have been the most-powerful governor in the nation, due to *personal* power -- his "iron-fisted personality and institutional knowledge of government operations". Personal power can be lost more easily than institutional power.

## Power of the New York governor (2) {.smaller}

-   E.J. McMahon ([optional reading](https://www.empirecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IB-Unbalanced.Update.pdf) - sleeper) was nuanced about budget power:
    -   NY governor is powerful in budget process, but by constitutional design rather than judicial activism

    -   Legislature has power within the system - can override line-item vetos (and has done so); ability to strike out or reduce appropriations is considerable power

    -   Argues legislature has some institutional options that don't require amending constitution: change fiscal year to July 1 to allow more time to review budget, and establish a legislative budget office

## Stylized view of budget (and beyond) influencers

![](images/image-180655092.png)

## Discussion

-   Do you know who the influencers are for your research paper?

-   Do you understand what may influence them?

    -   Who funds them?

    -   Who sits on their board?

    -   Who leads them?

# Constitutions

## What is a constitution? {.smaller}

-   Fundamental law of an organization. Sets boundaries for what a government may and may not do.

-   Hard to change

-   State constitutions are far more detailed than U.S. Constitution (e.g., NY Constitution is \> 6x as long as U.S.).

-   Sometimes constitutional provisions don't mean what you think they mean until they've been fully litigated.

-   You don't need to be constitutional scholars, but it's important to have a general understanding of constitutional principles and the roles constitutions play, as that will help you know when you need to consult with experts.

## U.S. Constitution - Selected Elements {.smaller}

-   [Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2)](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-6/clause-2/) - federal laws are supreme, state laws lesser

-   [Reserved Powers (10th Amendment)](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt10-3-2/ALDE_00013622/) - powers not delegated to U.S. are reserved to states; "police power" of the state (health, safety, morals, general welfare)

-   [Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3)](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C3-7-5/ALDE_00013311) - Congress has power to regulate interstate commerce; limits states' abilities to "burden" interstate commerce

-   [Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses (14th Amendment)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-14) - clauses protect citizens' rights to due process and equal protection under the law

-   [Contract Clause (Article I, Section 10, Clause 1)](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S10-C1-6-1/ALDE_00013037) - states cannot impair contracts; among other things this clause can limit state ability to apply laws retroactively,

## Commerce Clause {.bigger}

<p><br /></p>

Article I, Section 8, Clause 3:

> *\[The Congress shall have Power . . . \] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes; . . .*

::: notes
[Dormant](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C3-7-1/ALDE_00013307/) Commerce Clause - the clause can prohibit state laws that unduly restrict interstate commerce even in the absence of congressional legislation---i.e., where Congress is dormant.
:::

## Commerce Clause - Internet sales tax example {.smaller}

-   *Quill v. North Dakota* (USSC 1992): states can't require sellers without a physical presence in a state (e.g., Quill, L.L. Bean, etc.) to collect sales tax because it would create "undue burden" on interstate commerce.

-   *South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.* (USSC 2018) overturned this, said technology changes had reduced the burden, it's ok to require collection without physical presence if enough economic presence in the state.

-   *Wayfair* opened door for NY and other states to broadly require collection of sales tax on internet transactions -- e.g., Amazon marketplace sellers -- hundreds of \$ millions of new tax revenue from taxes already owed but previously uncollectible.

## Commerce Clause - Waste-hauling example {.smaller}

-   *C&A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown* (USSC 1994). Town ordinance required that local waste be processed at town transfer station.

-   Out-of-state hauler challenged on grounds that ordinance interfered with interstate commerce.

-   USSC overturned ordinance, said undue burden on interstate commerce.

-   As a result, among other things, counties can't require waste haulers to bring waste to a county incineration plant. (Significant issue in Washington County.)

## Commerce Clause - NYC Commuter tax example {.smaller}

**U.S. Supreme Court ruled legislature cannot impose tax on NJ/CT commuters to NYC, while not imposing tax on Westchester/Nassau commuters to NYC**

-   In 1999, [purportedly to influence suburban NY state Senate elections](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/18/nyregion/legislature-acts-quickly-to-repeal-commuter-tax.html), NYS legislature repealed the NYC commuter tax on in-state commuters but left it in place for out-of-state commuters.

-   *City of New York v. State of New York* (NYCA 2003) threw out the tax on out-of-state commuters on Commerce Clause and [Privileges or Immunities](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-14/section-1/current-doctrine) grounds.

-   Legislature anticipated this: [Ch. 5, Laws 1999](http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/navigate.cgi) was written so that entire commuter tax would self-destruct if in-state commuter exemption was invalidated. \[severability\]

-   Thus, NYC lost revenue from out-of-state commuters as intended, and from in-state commuters as well.

## Due Process and Equal Protection

<p><br /></p>

Excerpt from 14th Amendment:

> *No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.*

What's the difference between a person and an individual?

## NYS Constitution example: Sound Basic Education (1) {.smaller}

-   School funding is extraordinarily unequal across local school districts in New York and in most other states in large part because education funding relies heavily on local property taxes, which can be more readily levied in richer and wealthier school districts. Redistributional school aid from the state only partially compensates for this. As a result, educational opportunities are highly unequal.

-   For decades, many groups around the country challenged state school funding, initially on U.S. Constitutional equal protection grounds. These claims were unsuccessful - *San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez (USSC 1973)* ruled that education is not a fundamental right protected by the U.S. Constitution.

-   Groups then began to challenge education funding under state constitutions, where rulings were highly dependent on specific phrases in each constitution. Often the challenges sought "adequate" educational funding, rather than "equal" funding.

## NYS Constitution example: Sound Basic Education (2) {.smaller}

-   The NY Constitution says, "The legislature shall provide for the maintenance and support of a system of free common schools, wherein all the children of this state may be educated." (Article XI, Section 1)

-   In *Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc. v. State of New York* (NYSC-1995, NYAD-2002, NYCA-2006), CFE argued that there was **insufficient** funding for public schools in the city, particularly schools in low-income areas. (Note that this is an adequacy argument, not an equal-funding argument.)

-   The state Supreme Court (the "court of original jurisdiction", or first to hear a case) held that the constitutional duty to provide a "system of free common schools" required provision of a "sound basic education" to all students in the state. (This term is not in the state constitution.)

::: notes
Mention Hamp's work.
:::

## NYS Constitution example: Sound Basic Education (3) {.smaller}

-   The state Supreme Court ruled that a sound basic education includes the basic skills necessary for students to function in society and to be prepared for further education.

-   The Court of Appeals elaborated, saying a sound basic education also encompasses the skills necessary to function in a democratic society, such as critical thinking, problem solving, and the ability to communicate effectively.

-   It upheld the lower court's decision and ordered the state to increase funding to schools in New York City by \$5.6 billion. (In the wake of CFE the state did increase funding for schools, although there is ongoing controversy over the extent to which it met the court's requirement.)

## Two ways to amend NY Constitution {.smaller}

-   Legislative approach:

    -   Introduce amendment in each house, THEN must be approved by majority in each house of 2 separately elected legislatures (once before & once after a November election) THEN, subsequent approval by voters.
    -   Can take years

-   Constitutional convention approach:

    -   Every 20 years a proposition to hold a constitutional convention is put before voters in a general election.
    -   If a majority approve, elected delegates in Senate and Assembly districts propose constitutional amendments. Proposed amendments placed on the ballot of next general election.
    -   Can take years. Voters did NOT approve a constitutional convention at the last two opportunities (2017 and 1997 elections). The next vote will be in 2037.

-   NY Constitution does not allow amendment by initiative or referendum

# Appendices

# Public Authorities

## What are they and why are they important? {.smaller}

-   Public benefit corporations created by legislature. Important governmental activities; power to enter into contracts, issue debt. Examples:

    -   *Operating activities*: MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) - subways, buses, commuter rail, NYC + 7 counties; Port Authority NY/NJ, Dormitory Authority, Thruway Authority

    -   *Debt-issuance*: Local Government Assistance Corporation

    -   *Economic development entities*: Empire State Development Corporation; local IDAs (Industrial Development Agencies)

-   Avoid many rules and requirements of state government. Fly substantially under the radar. Issue debt without voter approval. Tax incentives for economic development.

-   Financially important: Only \~\$2b of NY's \~\$70b debt is voter-approved GO, much of remainder is authority debt; Only \$200+b of NY spending is appropriated; \$40+b is through authorities, more throughother entities; *potential fiscal risk to the state*

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

# Appendix: What is New York?

## What is a government? {.smaller}

-   [Legal (Cornell LII)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/government) - an entity "invested with the **power to manage a political unit**, organization or more often, a State"

-   [Accounting (Governmental Accounting Standards Board -- GASB)](https://gasb.org/page/PageContent?pageId=/standards-guidance/pronouncements/summary--statement-no-14.html): includes "legally separate organizations if \[state\] officials appoint a voting majority of an organization's governing body and either it is able to impose its will on that organization or..." potential for burden or benefits to the state

-   [Statistical (Census)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gus/technical-documentation/methodology/population-of-interest1.html) - ... organized entity with corporate powers (e.g, ability to make contracts), governmental character (e.g., officers are popularly elected or appointed by public officials, or can levy taxes, issue tax-exempt debt, or make laws), with substantial autonomy (e.g., budget not subject to review by other governments). Grey areas: special districts, certain municipal utilities, and public-private partnerships.

## What is New York State? {.smaller}

-   New York State is a vast, sprawling set of entities.

-   The budget includes just a portion of the state - the portion for which the legislature appropriates spending. (About \$209 billion in 2022.)

-   For example, [NY's financial statements](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/finance/pdf/annual-comprehensive-financial-report-2022.pdf) (pp.165+) list 43 public authorities that are part of the state, but generally are NOT appropriated by the legislature, including: the Dormitory Authority, the Long Island Power Authority, the MTA, NYSERDA, SUNY Foundations. They had \$43 billion of expenses in 2022 (MTA was largest).

-   Many of these entities are considered part of the state because "the Governor, with the approval of the State Senate, appoints the voting majority of the boards of directors of these Corporations, and the State is able to impose its will on the Corporations" (per the financial statements).

-   Census Bureau also has a [list of entities they consider part of the state](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2017/econ/2017isd.pdf) (pp.208+).

-   \--\> Legislature's oversight and legal responsibilities extend far beyond the budget.

# Appendix: The governor

## The Governor's emergency powers {.smaller}

-   According to John Dinan of Wake Forest University, "[governors are in most states authorized by state statutes to act unilaterally and in sweeping fashion in responding to emergencies](https://www.federalismindex.org/post/the-emergency-powers-of-state-governments-and-governors-in-the-u-s-federal-system)". Reflects state "police power"; COVID-19 widespread use.

-   NY: "...governor may by executive order **temporarily suspend specific provisions of any statute, local law**, ordinance, or orders, rules or regulations, or parts thereof, of any agency during a state disaster emergency, if compliance with such provisions would prevent, hinder, or delay action necessary..." (Exec. Law sec. 29-a)

-   EO limited to 30 days (with 30-day renewals); suspensions must safeguard health and welfare, be reasonably necessary to disaster effort, have minimum deviation from statute. Legislature may terminate EO by concurrent resolution.

-   Emergency powers raise questions about legislative oversight. We'll revisit in the "Who makes law and policy?" class; Dr. Penksa has prepared excellent materials.

## A few lessons re: gubernatorial power

-   NY governor is powerful, but legislature has power also
-   Personal power can be extraordinarily important, but potentially fleeting
-   Common measures of power miss important nuances
-   Caveat emptor to users of research

# Appendix: The Comptroller

## The State Comptroller {.smaller}

-   **Fiscal oversight**: Audit and review financial transactions and management practices of state and municipalities. Some excellent analytic reports about state programs and local governments. Fiscal stress monitoring.

-   **Budget and financial management**: Analyze state budget and financial management practices; make recommendations to governor, legislature, agencies. Small formal role in budget.

-   **Pay and benefits**: Manage state payroll and employee benefits system, including state pension system - sole trustee NYSLRS

-   **Debt management**: Issue and managing the state's debt

-   **Transparency**: Public information and data regarding state finances

## The Comptroller's analyses and audits {.smaller}

-   [Public authorities are huge operations](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/special-topics/pdf/public-authorities-2022.pdf): more than 1,000 state and local entities spend more than \$78 billion per year and have more than \$329 billion in debt outstanding

-   [Almost 2.7 million New Yorkers lived in poverty](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/new-yorkers-need-look-poverty-trends-new-york-state-last-decade) in 2021 -- 13.9% vs. 12.8% U.S.

-   [New York opioid-related deaths grew 68%](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/continuing-crisis-drug-overdose-deaths-new-york) between 2019 and 2021, driven by illicit fentanyl and similar synthetic opioids

-   [\$ billions of erroneous unemployment insurance payments](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/state-agencies/audits/2022/11/15/controls-and-management-unemployment-insurance-system) resulted from management and oversight failures in the state Department of Labor; the estimated fraud rate rose to 17.6% in 2022 from 4.5% in 2020.

# Appendix: Influencers, advocates, interest groups

## Lobbyists and advocates {.smaller}

-   A significant part of the New York system. Even local governments have NYS lobbyists.

-   Quotes/paraphrases from Kersh (optional reading folder):

    -   "What do lobbyists---and the clients they represent---receive... no one really knows". My light update suggests this is still true.

    -   NY lobbyists not as dominating as in FL, NV; complementary.

    -   NY lobbyists work closely with decisionmakers but face institutional and competitive constraints

-   Three categories: (1) single-group lobbyists (e.g., for a company or organization), (2) single-topic lobbyists (e.g., trade association or policy topic), (3) contract lobbyists.

-   What do lobbyists do? Monitoring, provide information, analysis, draft legislation, advocacy, arm twisting. May play significant roles in complex issues that require industry/group expertise.

-   *City & State* articles (required reading) mention prominent lobbyists and clients. *NYT* article (Goodman, optional folder) is interesting. Commission on Ethics and Lobbying to replace Joint Commission on Public Ethics (JCOPE) ([article](https://www.news10.com/news/ny-ethics-commission-replacing-jcope-makes-progress/))

# Appendix: Other states

## Why you should care about what other states do {.smaller}

-   Lessons learned - what worked for them, what didn't

-   States are copycats (policy diffusion) - if other states are doing it, may increase the odds of support in New York, Fear of leaving the herd if they're not doing it.

Good resource on state institutions and practices: [*Book of the States*](https://issuu.com/csg.publications/stacks/46495f12f95847e6935d331969ed650a)

Big differences in demographics, economies, politics, and attitudes across states, so lessons elsewhere not necessarily applicable. Still, it's good to know what they're doing.

## New York and other states

## Not discussed, or only barely {.smaller}

-   Attorney general

-   Courts except as they relate to the constitution

-   The Legislature (you'll have great mentors)

-   Federal-state-local relationships (a separate lecture)

-   The budget (you had separate session)

-   State agencies and public authorities (only barely)

-   The media

There are some great books and papers in the resources folder.

# Appendix: The Constitution

## Due Process example {.smaller}

-   NY legislature passed the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement (SAFE) Act in 2013 in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting. Among other things, it expanded the assault weapons ban to include certain semi-automatic firearms with detachable magazines, limited magazine size, and regulated certain pistols that are **"semiautomatic version\[s\] of an automatic rifle, shotgun or firearm"**.

-   Many provisions were challenged in state and federal court on Second Amendment, Due Process, and other grounds. Most were upheld.

-   However, in [New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Cuomo](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1001140/ruling-from-the-united-states-district-court-for.pdf) (US District Court WDNY 2013), three provisions were found unconstitutional under the "void-for-vagueness" doctrine, which stems from the [Due Process clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt14-S1-3/ALDE_00013743).

-   The provision regulating pistols that are semiautomatic versions of automatic weapons was invalidated as 'excessively vague, as an ordinary person cannot know whether any single semiautomatic pistol is a "version" of an automatic one'.

## New York State Constitution {.smaller}

-   See Benjamin (required reading)

-   Many provisions mirror counterparts in the U.S. Constitution - e.g., Bill of Rights

-   In addition, the NY constitution:

    -   Lays out the structure of government including the executive, legislature, and judiciary. For judiciary, we're concerned here with:

        -   *Court of Appeals* (highest court, counterpart to U.S. Supreme Court)

        -   *Appellate Division* - hears appeals from lower courts, and certain other cases

        -   *Supreme Court* (trial court, or court of original jurisdiction)

    -   Establishes requirements and procedures for state and local finances, taxation, and limits on debt.

    -   Explicitly addresses many policy issues, including education, social welfare, housing, and conservation.

-   These provisions have important consequences for procedure and for policy.
