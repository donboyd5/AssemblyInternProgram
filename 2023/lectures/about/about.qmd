-   3 lectures:

    -   The Context for Policymaking in New York

    -   Federal, State, & Local Government Relations and Interactions

    -   Executive Law- and Policy-making and the Legislative Role

-   Each of you will do a 2-minute presentation:

    -   A crucial skill

    -   Describe and analyze a proposal or issue - analysis, not advocacy (at this point)

    -   Every presentation is a job interview

-   Readings - I may call randomly on students to briefly describe key points from one of the required readings.

## I will discuss a 10-minute skill in each lecture {.smaller}

Examples:

-   How to assess the POV of an organization

-   How to know what "the science" says

-   How to get advice from an expert

-   How to give advice to a non-expert

-   How to keep the ball rolling (and re a recent question about absences)

<!-- ## Depth {.smaller} -->

<!-- -   We cannot possibly cover important elements of the 3 lectures, in depth, in an 85 minute class in which we also have student 2-minute presentations. -->

<!-- -   I will try, in the slides, to give depth and real-world illustrations. You do not need to memorize these. -->

<!-- -   I will try to give links that allow you to explore the issues and illustrations more deeply. -->

<!-- ## Grading -->

<!-- -   No quizzes -->

<!-- -   Attendance; I expect participation -->

## Lecture slides

-   Slides currently on the web for the classes are from Cycle 2

-   Feel free to look ahead but please be aware that the slides may change, although not dramatically.

-   I will post an announcement and update links when updated versions are available.

<!-- ## Slide logistics {.smaller} -->

<!-- -   My slides are in reveal.js format. It doesn't convert easily or well to Powerpoint or landscape pdfs. -->

<!-- -   Slides will have links and information that I hope will be useful to you. I will do two things to try to make them accessible: -->

<!--     -   Put the substantive slides on the web as html so you can access them that way. That will work well, but you probably won't be able to save them to pdf in a usable form from the web. -->

<!--     -   I will try to create a pdf of the slides in portrait mode and put them on Moodle. So far, these conversions are working pretty well but no guarantees they always will. -->

## Advice about the research paper {.smaller}

-   I will not be grading your papers (although I may review and comment). Whenever you write anything, ask (1) Who's the audience?, (2) What's the purpose?

-   I have told the students I am grading that *their* audience and purpose are two-fold:

    -   An Assemblymember who wants a full 360 degrees view of a proposal

    -   A public policy-interested audience with time to dig in, wants details & sources

-   And I have told them I am looking for:

    -   1-page up-front summary (Assemblymembers are busy, must split their attention)

    -   Describe and analyze the *proposal* (esp. bill language), not just the *issue*. Heard often: "*Vote on the bill, not the memo.*"

    -   Be rigorous: Document your analysis, draw on original sources & cite them.

    -   Be concise and clear: **writing is rewriting**. Strunk & White is on Moodle. Dr. JP thinks highly of Smith, *Writing Public Policy* (I have not read it yet).

-   Best to be sure you understand expectations of the professor grading your paper.
