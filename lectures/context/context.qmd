## Context affects policymaking {.smaller}

State policymaking is influenced by many contextual factors, such as:

-   Constitutions and laws

-   Powers of the branches of government

-   Institutional structure of government

-   Interest groups

Goals:

-   Understand major ways in which context can affect NY policymaking

-   Learn of resources that can help you teach yourself more

# Constitutions

## Basics

-   Fundamental law of an organization. Sets boundaries for what a government may and may not do

-   Hard to change

-   State constitutions far more detailed than U.S. Constitution (e.g., NY Constitution is \> 6x as long as U.S.)

## U.S. Constitution - Selected Elements {.smaller}

-   [Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2)](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-6/clause-2/) - federal laws are supreme, state laws lesser

-   [Reserved Powers (10th Amendment)](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt10-3-2/ALDE_00013622/) - powers not delegated to U.S. are reserved to states; "police power" of the state (health, safety, morals, general welfare)

-   [Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3)](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C3-7-5/ALDE_00013311) - Congress has power to regulate interstate commerce; limits states' abilities to "burden" interstate commerce

-   [Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses (14th Amendment)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-14) - clauses protect citizens' rights to due process and equal protection under the law

-   [Contract Clause (Article I, Section 10, Clause 1)](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S10-C1-6-1/ALDE_00013037) - states cannot impair contracts; among other things can limit state ability to apply laws retroactively,

## Commerce Clause examples (1) {.smaller}

-   **Internet and sales taxes**

    -   *Quill v. North Dakota* (USSC 1992): states can't require sellers without a physical presence in a state (e.g., Quill, L.L. Bean, etc.) to collect sales tax because it would create "undue burden" on interstate commerce.

    -   *South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.* (USSC 2018) overturned this, said technology changes had reduced the burden, it's ok to require collection without physical presence if enough economic presence in the state.

    -   *Wayfair* opened door for NY and other states to broadly require collection of sales tax on internet transactions -- e.g., Amazon marketplace sellers -- \$ millions of new tax revenue from taxes already owed but previously uncollectible.

## Commerce Clause examples (2) {.smaller}

-   **Can't force waste haulers to truck solid waste to local facilities**

    -   *C&A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown* (USSC 1994). Town ordinance required that local waste be processed at town transfer station.

    -   Out-of-state hauler challenged on grounds that it interfered with interstate commerce.

    -   USSC overturned ordinance, said undue burden on interstate commerce.

    -   As a result, among other things, counties can't require waste haulers to bring waste to a county incineration plant. (Significant issue in Washington County.

## Commerce Clause examples (3) {.smaller}

-   **Can't impose NYC commuter tax on NJ/CT commuters to NYC, while not imposing commuter tax on Westchester/Nassau commuters to NYC**

    -   In 1999, [purportedly to influence suburban NY state Senate elections](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/18/nyregion/legislature-acts-quickly-to-repeal-commuter-tax.html), NYS Legislature repealed the NYC commuter tax on in-state commuters but left it in place for out-of-state commuters.

    -   *City of New York v. State of New York* (NYCA 2003) threw out the tax on out-of-state commuters on Commerce Clause and [Privileges or Immunities](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-14/section-1/current-doctrine) grounds.

    -   Legislature anticipated this: [Ch. 5, Laws 1999](http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/navigate.cgi) written so that entire commuter tax would self-destruct if in-state commuter exemption was invalidated. \[severability\]

    -   Thus, NYC lost revenue from out-of-state commuters as intended, and from in-state commuters as well.

## Due Process example {.smaller}

-   NY Legislature passed the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement (SAFE) Act in 2013 in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting. Among other things, it expanded the assault weapons ban to include certain semi-automatic firearms with detachable magazines, limited magazine size, and regulated certain pistols that are "semiautomatic version\[s\] of an automatic rifle, shotgun or firearm".

-   Many provisions were challenged in state and federal court on Second Amendment, Due Process, and other grounds. Most were upheld.

-   However, in [New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Cuomo](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1001140/ruling-from-the-united-states-district-court-for.pdf) (US District Court WDNY 2013), three provisions were found unconstitutional under the "void-for-vagueness" doctrine, which stems from the [Due Process clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt14-S1-3/ALDE_00013743).

-   The provision regulating pistols that are semiautomatic versions of automatic weapons was invalidated as 'excessively vague, as an ordinary person cannot know whether any single semiautomatic pistol is a "version" of an automatic one'.

## New York State Constitution

-   Far more detailed and prescriptive than U.S. Const. \~6x as long

# What is a Government? What is New York State?

## What is a government? {.smaller}

-   [Legal (Cornell LII)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/government) - an entity "invested with the **power to manage a political unit**, organization or more often, a State"

-   [Accounting (Governmental Accounting Standards Board -- GASB)](https://gasb.org/page/PageContent?pageId=/standards-guidance/pronouncements/summary--statement-no-14.html): includes "legally separate organizations if \[state\] officials appoint a voting majority of an organization's governing body and either it is able to impose its will on that organization or..." potential for burden or benefits to the state

-   [Statistical (Census)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gus/technical-documentation/methodology/population-of-interest1.html) - ... organized entity with corporate powers (e.g, ability to make contracts), governmental character (e.g., officers are popularly elected or appointed by public officials, or can levy taxes, issue tax-exempt debt, or make laws), with substantial autonomy (e.g., budget not subject to review by other governments). Grey areas: special districts, certain municipal utilities, and public-private partnerships.

Most school districts in New York are separate governments with publicly elected school boards and the ability to tax, but **some are not** - for example, the NYC, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Yonkers school districts are part of their city governments.

## What is New York State? {.smaller}

-   New York State is a vast, sprawling set of entities.

-   The budget includes just a portion of the state - the portion for which the legislature appropriates spending. (About \$209 billion in 2022.)

-   For example, [NY's financial statements](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/finance/pdf/annual-comprehensive-financial-report-2022.pdf) (pp.165+) list 43 public authorities that are part of the state, but generally are NOT appropriated by the legislature, including: the Dormitory Authority, the Long Island Power Authority, the MTA, NYSERDA, SUNY Foundations. They had \$43 billion of expenses in 2022 (MTA was largest).

-   Many of these entities are considered part of the state because "the Governor, with the approval of the State Senate, appoints the voting majority of the boards of directors of these Corporations, and the State is able to impose its will on the Corporations".

-   Census Bureau also has a [list of entities they consider part of the state](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2017/econ/2017isd.pdf) (pp.208+).

-   The Legislature's oversight and legal responsibilities in the state reach far beyond the budget.

# The Attorney General

# The Courts

The [court system in New York State](https://www.nycourts.gov/) is divided into four levels: the Court of Appeals, the Appellate Division, the Supreme Court, and the local courts.

The Court of Appeals is the highest court in the state and is located in Albany. It is composed of a Chief Judge and six Associate Judges, and it has the authority to review decisions made by the lower courts.

The Appellate Division is the intermediate appellate court and is located in each of the four judicial departments of the state: the First Department (covering Manhattan and the Bronx), the Second Department (covering Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and Long Island), the Third Department (covering the remainder of the Hudson Valley and Catskills regions), and the Fourth Department (covering the remainder of the state). It has the authority to review decisions made by the Supreme Court and local courts.

The Supreme Court is the trial court of general jurisdiction in the state and is located in each county. It has the authority to hear cases involving criminal offenses, civil disputes, and a variety of other matters.

Local courts include the District Court, the City Court, the Town and Village Court, and the Traffic Violations Bureau. These courts have limited jurisdiction and handle cases such as minor criminal offenses, traffic violations, and small claims disputes.
