## Goals

-   Who controls state government?
-   Who runs the state government?
-   Who makes policy?

# Statewide Elected Officials

# Governor

## What makes a governor powerful? How powerful is New York's governor?

## Departments and Agencies

## Public Authorities

# Legislature

# The Comptroller

# The Attorney General

# The Courts

The [court system in New York State](https://www.nycourts.gov/) is divided into four levels: the Court of Appeals, the Appellate Division, the Supreme Court, and the local courts.

The Court of Appeals is the highest court in the state and is located in Albany. It is composed of a Chief Judge and six Associate Judges, and it has the authority to review decisions made by the lower courts.

The Appellate Division is the intermediate appellate court and is located in each of the four judicial departments of the state: the First Department (covering Manhattan and the Bronx), the Second Department (covering Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and Long Island), the Third Department (covering the remainder of the Hudson Valley and Catskills regions), and the Fourth Department (covering the remainder of the state). It has the authority to review decisions made by the Supreme Court and local courts.

The Supreme Court is the trial court of general jurisdiction in the state and is located in each county. It has the authority to hear cases involving criminal offenses, civil disputes, and a variety of other matters.

Local courts include the District Court, the City Court, the Town and Village Court, and the Traffic Violations Bureau. These courts have limited jurisdiction and handle cases such as minor criminal offenses, traffic violations, and small claims disputes.
