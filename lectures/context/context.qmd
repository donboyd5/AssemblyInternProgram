## Goals

-   Get advice or information from a busy expert who:
    -   ordinarily might not respond to you
    -   might even be wary - legislative staff can be scary
-   Get them to respond, and be helpful
-   FYI - [Census Reporter](https://censusreporter.org/) [district profiles](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/62000US36001-assembly-district-1-ny/)

CAUTION: This is hard work

## Good questions for a quiz

-   Keep email visually short and nonthreatening

    -
