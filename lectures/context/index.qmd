# Constitutions

## Basics {.smaller}

-   Fundamental law of an organization. Sets boundaries for what a government may and may not do.

-   Hard to change

-   State constitutions are far more detailed than U.S. Constitution (e.g., NY Constitution is \> 6x as long as U.S.).

-   Sometimes constitutional provisions don't mean what you think they mean until they've been fully litigated.

-   You don't need to be constitutional scholars, but it's important to have a general understanding of constitutional principles and the roles constitutions play, as that will help you know when you need to consult with experts.

## U.S. Constitution - Selected Elements {.smaller}

-   [Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2)](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-6/clause-2/) - federal laws are supreme, state laws lesser

-   [Reserved Powers (10th Amendment)](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt10-3-2/ALDE_00013622/) - powers not delegated to U.S. are reserved to states; "police power" of the state (health, safety, morals, general welfare)

-   [Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3)](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C3-7-5/ALDE_00013311) - Congress has power to regulate interstate commerce; limits states' abilities to "burden" interstate commerce

-   [Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses (14th Amendment)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-14) - clauses protect citizens' rights to due process and equal protection under the law

-   [Contract Clause (Article I, Section 10, Clause 1)](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S10-C1-6-1/ALDE_00013037) - states cannot impair contracts; among other things this clause can limit state ability to apply laws retroactively,

## Commerce Clause {.bigger}

<p><br /></p>

Article I, Section 8, Clause 3:

> *\[The Congress shall have Power . . . \] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes; . . .*

::: notes
[Dormant](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C3-7-1/ALDE_00013307/) Commerce Clause - the clause can prohibit state laws that unduly restrict interstate commerce even in the absence of congressional legislation---i.e., where Congress is dormant.
:::

## Commerce Clause - Internet sales tax example {.smaller}

-   *Quill v. North Dakota* (USSC 1992): states can't require sellers without a physical presence in a state (e.g., Quill, L.L. Bean, etc.) to collect sales tax because it would create "undue burden" on interstate commerce.

-   *South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.* (USSC 2018) overturned this, said technology changes had reduced the burden, it's ok to require collection without physical presence if enough economic presence in the state.

-   *Wayfair* opened door for NY and other states to broadly require collection of sales tax on internet transactions -- e.g., Amazon marketplace sellers -- hundreds of \$ millions of new tax revenue from taxes already owed but previously uncollectible.

## Commerce Clause - Waste-hauling example {.smaller}

-   *C&A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown* (USSC 1994). Town ordinance required that local waste be processed at town transfer station.

-   Out-of-state hauler challenged on grounds that ordinance interfered with interstate commerce.

-   USSC overturned ordinance, said undue burden on interstate commerce.

-   As a result, among other things, counties can't require waste haulers to bring waste to a county incineration plant. (Significant issue in Washington County.

## Commerce Clause - NYC Commuter tax example {.smaller}

-   **Can't impose NYC commuter tax on NJ/CT commuters to NYC, while not imposing commuter tax on Westchester/Nassau commuters to NYC**

-   In 1999, [purportedly to influence suburban NY state Senate elections](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/18/nyregion/legislature-acts-quickly-to-repeal-commuter-tax.html), NYS Legislature repealed the NYC commuter tax on in-state commuters but left it in place for out-of-state commuters.

-   *City of New York v. State of New York* (NYCA 2003) threw out the tax on out-of-state commuters on Commerce Clause and [Privileges or Immunities](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-14/section-1/current-doctrine) grounds.

-   Legislature anticipated this: [Ch. 5, Laws 1999](http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/navigate.cgi) written so that entire commuter tax would self-destruct if in-state commuter exemption was invalidated. \[severability\]

-   Thus, NYC lost revenue from out-of-state commuters as intended, and from in-state commuters as well.

## Due Process and Equal Protection

<p><br /></p>

Excerpt from 14th Amendment:

> *No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.*

::: notes
What's the difference between a person and an individual?
:::

## Due Process example {.smaller}

-   NY Legislature passed the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement (SAFE) Act in 2013 in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting. Among other things, it expanded the assault weapons ban to include certain semi-automatic firearms with detachable magazines, limited magazine size, and regulated certain pistols that are **"semiautomatic version\[s\] of an automatic rifle, shotgun or firearm"**.

-   Many provisions were challenged in state and federal court on Second Amendment, Due Process, and other grounds. Most were upheld.

-   However, in [New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Cuomo](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1001140/ruling-from-the-united-states-district-court-for.pdf) (US District Court WDNY 2013), three provisions were found unconstitutional under the "void-for-vagueness" doctrine, which stems from the [Due Process clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt14-S1-3/ALDE_00013743).

-   The provision regulating pistols that are semiautomatic versions of automatic weapons was invalidated as 'excessively vague, as an ordinary person cannot know whether any single semiautomatic pistol is a "version" of an automatic one'.

## New York State Constitution {.smaller}

-   Many provisions mirror counterparts in the U.S. Constitution - e.g., Bill of Rights

-   In addition, the NY constitution:

    -   Lays out the structure of government including the executive, legislature, and judiciary

    -   Establishes requirements and procedures for state and local finances, taxation, and limits on debt.

    -   Explicitly addresses many policy issues, including education, social welfare, housing, and conservation.

-   Many of these provisions have important consequences for procedure and for policy.

## NYS Constitution example: Sound Basic Education (1) {.smaller}

-   School funding is extraordinarily unequal across local school districts in New York and in most other states in large part because education funding relies heavily on local property taxes, which can be more readily levied in richer and wealthier school districts. Redistributional school aid from the state only partially compensates for this. As a result, educational opportunities are highly unequal.

-   Over many decades, many groups have challenged state school funding, initially on U.S. Constitutional equal protection grounds. These claims were unsuccessful - *San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez (USSC 1973)* ruled that education is not a fundamental right protected by the U.S. Constitution.

-   Groups then began to challenge education funding under state constitutions, where rulings were highly dependent on specific phrases in each constitution. Often the challenges sought "adequate" educational funding, rather than "equal" funding.

## NYS Constitution example: Sound Basic Education (2) {.smaller}

-   The NY Constitution says, "The legislature shall provide for the maintenance and support of a system of free common schools, wherein all the children of this state may be educated." (Article XI, Section 1)

-   In *Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc. v. State of New York* (NYSC-1995, NYAD-2002, NYCA-2006), CFE argued that there was **insufficient** funding for public schools in the city, particularly schools in low-income areas. (Note that this is an adequacy argument, not an equal-funding argument.)

-   The state Supreme Court (the "court of original jurisdiction", or first to hear a case) held that the constitutional duty to provide a "system of free common schools" required provision of a "sound basic education" to all students in the state. (This term is not in the state constitution.)

::: notes
Mention Hamp's work.
:::

## NYS Constitution example: Sound Basic Education (3) {.smaller}

-   The state Supreme Court ruled that a sound basic education includes the basic skills necessary for students to function in society and to be prepared for further education.

-   The Court of Appeals elaborated, saying a sound basic education also the skills necessary to function in a democratic society, such as critical thinking, problem solving, and the ability to communicate effectively.

-   It upheld the lower court's decision and ordered the state to increase funding to schools in New York City by \$5.6 billion. (In the wake of CFE the state did increase funding for schools, although there is ongoing controversy over the extent to which it met the court's requirement.)

## Amending the NY Constitution (1) {.smaller}

-   Legislative approach - neither easy nor quick. It requires:

    -   Introduce amendment in each house, THEN
    -   Must be approved by majority in each house of 2 separately elected legislatures (once before & once after a November election)
        -   2022 and 2023 would count

        -   2023 and 2024 would not count - we'd need either 2023 or 2024 legislature, plus the 2025 legislature (i.e., one before and one after the November 2024 election)
    -   THEN, subsequent approval by voters

## Amending the NY Constitution (2) {.smaller}

-   Constitutional conventions

    -   Every twenty years a proposition to hold a constitutional convention must be put before the voters in a general election. At the same election, voters vote on 3 delegates to the convention from each Senate and Assembly district.
    -   If a majority of voters approve the convention, the elected delegates propose amendments to the Constitution.
    -   The proposed amendments are placed on the ballot during the next general election.
    -   If a majority of voters approve of the proposed amendments, they become part of the state Constitution.
    -   The process can take years. Voters did NOT approve a constitutional convention at the last two opportunities (2017 and 1997 elections). The next vote will be in 2037.

-   The NY Constitution does not allow for amendment by initiative or referendum

# What is a Government? What is New York State?

## What is a government? {.smaller}

-   [Legal (Cornell LII)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/government) - an entity "invested with the **power to manage a political unit**, organization or more often, a State"

-   [Accounting (Governmental Accounting Standards Board -- GASB)](https://gasb.org/page/PageContent?pageId=/standards-guidance/pronouncements/summary--statement-no-14.html): includes "legally separate organizations if \[state\] officials appoint a voting majority of an organization's governing body and either it is able to impose its will on that organization or..." potential for burden or benefits to the state

-   [Statistical (Census)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gus/technical-documentation/methodology/population-of-interest1.html) - ... organized entity with corporate powers (e.g, ability to make contracts), governmental character (e.g., officers are popularly elected or appointed by public officials, or can levy taxes, issue tax-exempt debt, or make laws), with substantial autonomy (e.g., budget not subject to review by other governments). Grey areas: special districts, certain municipal utilities, and public-private partnerships.

## What is New York State? {.smaller}

-   New York State is a vast, sprawling set of entities.

-   The budget includes just a portion of the state - the portion for which the legislature appropriates spending. (About \$209 billion in 2022.)

-   For example, [NY's financial statements](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/finance/pdf/annual-comprehensive-financial-report-2022.pdf) (pp.165+) list 43 public authorities that are part of the state, but generally are NOT appropriated by the legislature, including: the Dormitory Authority, the Long Island Power Authority, the MTA, NYSERDA, SUNY Foundations. They had \$43 billion of expenses in 2022 (MTA was largest).

-   Many of these entities are considered part of the state because "the Governor, with the approval of the State Senate, appoints the voting majority of the boards of directors of these Corporations, and the State is able to impose its will on the Corporations".

-   Census Bureau also has a [list of entities they consider part of the state](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2017/econ/2017isd.pdf) (pp.208+).

-   The Legislature's oversight and legal responsibilities in the state reach far beyond the budget.
