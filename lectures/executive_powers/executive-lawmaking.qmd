# Executive powers and the legislative role

## Why even care?

-   Does the executive overstep its bounds into legislative prerogatives?

-   If the executive is exercising appropriate power, *does or should the legislature have oversight responsibilities?*

## Executive branch has important law- and policymaking powers {.smaller}

-   Fleshing out the law: rules, opinions of counsel, technical memoranda, advisory opinions -- vagues statutes lead to administrative lawmaking

-   Executive orders

-   Emergency powers (the focus below)

-   Consent decrees (we won't have time for this, but they're important - please see readings)

Good resource, esp. rulemaking: [Ward, "Appointed Officials, Administrative Law, and The Bureaucracy" (Chapter 8)](https://intern.nyassembly.gov/mod/resource/view.php?id=1003)

## Emergency powers - the case of COVID-19 {.smaller}

-   Almost all states give governors emergency powers. As of mid-2017 NY & 34 others gave gov. power to suspend *statutes* and regulations (NC gives gov. power to create new statutes; HI governor is "sole judge" of the threat); 7 states give power to amend regulations; 8 give no explicit power.[^1]

-   Sunshine et al. argue these powers are important for implementing federal policy in public health crises.

-   Emergency powers also raise questions about separation of powers, and legislative oversight. Most states impose limitations, such as time limits, must call legislative special session, detailed specification and reporting requirements, .[^2]

-   Many govs had or were given extraordinary powers during COVID-19. Subsequently many states considered scaling back those powers.[^3]

## Who Read...?

-   Executive Law section 29-a?

    -   What does it say?

    -   Did anyone trace back to definitions it relies on, established in Exec Law sec. 20?

    -   Did anyone trace its legislative history? Compare it to section 29-a before and after Laws of 2020, Chapter 23 (a reading assignment)?

## The Situation

-   March 2, 2020. Beginning stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

-   *NYT* reported 2nd COVID-19 death near Seattle. NY just reported its first death.

-   At 7 pm, Gov. Cuomo requested the legislature act on a just-printed bill to enhance emergency powers (S.7919/A.9953), under a **message of necessity**.[^4]

-   Legislators are seeing the bill for the first time.

-   Senate just passed S.7919 (53-4).

-   It's 10 pm. Assembly floor debate begins.

[^4]: NYS Constitution, Article III, Section 14: "No bill shall be passed or become a law unless it shall have been printed and upon the desks of the members, in its final form, at least three calendar legislative days ... unless the governor...shall have certified, under his or her hand and the seal of the state, the facts which in his or her opinion necessitate an immediate vote thereon,"

## Test your bill-reading skills. Key provision #1

1.  Expand the definition of disaster, Exec. Law sec. 20 (sunsets in a year)

![](images/image-1908020701.png)

**What does this mean?**

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
::: notes
1)  impending is not as soon as imminent

2)  disease outbreak can be less significant than epidemic

## Test your bill-reading skills. Key provision #2

2.  Expand emergency powers (sunsets in a year)

![](images/image-1228332030.png)

**What does this mean?**

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
::: notes
1)  Gov can suspend entire statutes, not just specific provisions

2)  Gov can issue DIRECTIVES to any person!

3)  Power expansions are not linked to COVID-19!

## Test your bill-reading skills. Key provision #3

3.  Appropriates \$40 million

![](images/image-289089875.png)

**What doesn't this say?**

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
::: notes
Doesn't put limits or reporting requirements (other than plan by DOB).

Gov can spend as desired, pursuant to a plan of DOB

Note that funding is limited to Covid 19 but power expansions are not

## R's offer amendment that is defeated

Proposed amendment says:

> Governor shall report to \[leaders, finance chairs, ranking members\] every 30 days for an accounting of all money distributed in relation to this appropriation

Defeated on grounds that Senate has already passed the bill, would have to amend and send back, no time for that.

## Much discussion of process {.smaller}

-   Is message of necessity appropriate?

    -   Haven't had time to read the bill, perhaps we should not give governor such powers without giving the public, outside experts a chance to review.

    -   Others argue there were no objections when the message was presented to the houses so that ship has sailed.

-   There might be powers and provisions that are not clear upon reading it - have only had it for a few hours.

-   Some members suggest splitting out the appropriation, giving that now, taking more time for emergency powers.

-   Asked whether the governor could declare a disaster now, or whether instead there would need to be a sudden increase in cases before a disaster declaration, the sponsor said that is correct - the governor could not declare disaster now.

## Who do you think said.... (R? D?)

> are you concerned that he \[Governor Cuomo\] can abuse it \[additional power\]?... If the President of the United States \[President Trump at the time\] went to the Congress and said, tie funding to fight the coronavirus to an increase in my Executive powers, would you support that?

## Who do you think said.... (R? D?) {.smaller}

> New York's Governor is one of the most powerful...during the worst of the HIV crisis, no Governor...ever...ask\[ed\] for anything like the powers...in this bill...very extensive and almost unlimited affirmative legislative power to not only waive existing laws and provisions of existing laws, which he now has authority to do, but it also empowers him to essentially make new legislation by issuing "directives," quote/ unquote, to any New Yorker....I can already hear people saying, Oooh, you know, he can do this for only 30 days at a time, and this expires April of 2021...Well, in theory yes, but think of all the things that this Governor and other Governors have got us to pass...and after two years well, we extend it again...And next April when there are things that we're all going to want in the budget **and the Governor says to us, Well, you know, if you want your thing in the Budget, here's what I want**. And before you know it, it's been years...

## Who do you think said.... (R? D?)

> we have a lot of seniors who are very, very frightened about the possibilities of a pandemic... Shame on you, Governor, that you would use the fear of the people to expand your power. And shame on us because tonight we're going to allow him to do that

## What happened

-   At 12:02 am on March 3, the bill passed (122-12), Laws 2020 Ch. 23

-   March 7 Governor issues [EO 202](https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/EO_202.pdf) under the new authority; considerable detail on statutes suspended

-   108 subsequent extensions, enhancements, adjustments; [EO 202.8](https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/EO_202_108.pdf) and several predecessors rescinded elements of prior suspensions

-   Considerable discontent with governor's expanded powers

## And then {.smaller}

-   March 2, 2021 S5357/A5967 (Stewart-Cousins/Heastie) introduced, scales back powers

    -   Extensive "legislative intent" (L.2020 Ch. 23 enacted amidst uncertainty; there's been progress; time to restore pre-pandemic balance of power)

    -   Rescinds power of governor to issue "directives"; existing directives continue but any extensions are tied to reporting requirements

    -   suspensions and directives must be on searchable website, and have specified detailed information

-   Backdrop: night before, NYT and I reported allegations Govs office rewrote/edited DOH report on NH deaths

-   March 5, 2021; bill has aged 3 days

-   273 page transcript of floor debate!

-   Bill passes, L.2021 Ch.71

-   Governor Hochul continues to use EO disaster power (health care staff shortage, windstorms, floods, other) within the Ch.71-reduced powers

## Any reactions?

-   Did the legislature leave the governor with too much power? Not enough?

-   Is the legislature exercising sufficient oversight?

-   Other?

## Lessons

-   Emergency powers raise important questions of the separation of powers and the legislature's role.

-   R's and D's can have similar views on separation of powers.

-   Interpreting legislation: Precise words matter

-   Research paper:

    -   Floor debates can be a rich source of information about pros and cons of legislation

    -   NCSL can be a great source of other states' policies
