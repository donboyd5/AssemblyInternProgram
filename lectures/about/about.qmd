## About the Course {.smaller}

-   3 lectures:

    -   The NY Context for Policymaking
    -   Federalism - who does what and why? how do governments interact?
    -   Who makes policy?

-   Class participation - 1-minute presentation, 1-minute impromptu comments

-   10-minute skills (1 per lecture) - examples:

    -   How to get advice from an expert

    -   How to give advice to a non-expert

    -   How to ask questions of an academic

    -   How to make a mistake

    -   How to keep the ball rolling

    -   How to be more powerful than you are

## Grading

-   Attendance and participation

-   I'll be grading your papers. I'll be especially interested in:

    -   Up-front summary

    -   Don't just describe and analyze the *issue* - describe and analyze the *proposal*.

    -   Be concise and clear: writing is rewriting.

    -   Careful use of original sources

## Optional

-   Your interests - please write 1 short paragraph that mentions a policy issue or two that you're interested in, or what you want to get out of the course or program.

-   Feedback - I would like anonymous feedback from students willing to offer it

    -   Would appreciate it if, after each lecture, one student can gather comments and copy into [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ymJzG2t4sdk8OEuFKtG7LoNw2M9ntNwTbSB9YDwH7WI/edit?usp=sharing)

    -   Ideally commenters will address tersely up to 3 questions about the lecture:

        1.  What was good?

        2.  What was bad?

        3.  What is 1 change that would improve it?
