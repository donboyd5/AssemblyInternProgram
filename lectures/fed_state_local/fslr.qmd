::: notes
The eight 2-minute presenters worked really hard to prepare and made a lot of great points.

Less lecturing by me (less presentation, push more to appendix)

More opportunity for questions/discussion

# [10-minute skill](https://boyd-science.netlify.app)

# First set of 2-minute presentations (timed)

-   Brevin Austin

-   Shlomie Katash

-   Matthew Brennan

-   Manal Alawsaj

Your classmates are legislators.

## Discussion of first set of presentations

-   *To our audience of legislators charged with decisonmaking:*

    -   What would you have liked to learn that you didn't?
    -   What would you have dispensed with to make room for it?

-   *To our presenters:*

    -   Was there information you were looking for that you couldn't find?
    -   Other challenges?
    -   What would you do differently if you did it again?

# Federal-state-local relationships in New York

## Why even care?

-   Some activities make more sense for one level of government than another

-   Getting things done often requires working with local govts, fed govt (as well as privates and non-profits)

-   Legal constraints and pre-emptions imposed by feds on states, by the state on locals

-   Politics can be complex. Other governments can be both adversaries and cooperators

-   Demographic, economic, and social differences across places affect politics

## Who should do what? Who should pay? {.smaller}

-   Who benefits from a policy?

    -   Does the whole nation benefit from an educated populace, or do just the children who are educated benefit, or is it in between? Are there "spillovers"?
    -   What about national defense? City garbage collection?

-   Who can administer a policy effectively? Should the federal government do garbage collection? Should villages collaborate and run the military?

-   Who can finance a policy?

    -   Why do states rely heavily on income taxes but local governments rely heavily on property taxes?

    -   What are some important differences between the two taxes?

-   Which level of government is closest to the people?

## Who does what?

![](images/image-1518810265.png)

## NY spends & taxes a lot more than other states (Medicaid & K-12)

![](images/image-1841803347.png){width="687"}

## Huge regional differences affect needs, wants, capacity, and politics

![](images/image-1609023654.png)

## NYC "gave" 45% of state taxes, "got" 40% of spending

![](images/image-683557828.png)

## 3,100+ local governments - crazy quilt

-   Counties, cities, towns, villages, school districts, ...

-   NYC: a city, county (5 of them), and school district all in one

-   Counties and NYC "exhaust" NY geography, no overlap

-   Towns and cities exhaust county geography, no overlap

-   In the 5 largest cities, school districts are part of the city budget.

-   Elsewhere they are freestanding. Politics of separate budget votes.

## After that, it's the wild west

-   Villages sit within/across towns\
    3 layers (counties/towns/villages) (police in Nassau County)

-   Villages cross town and even county borders - part here, part there

-   School districts exhaust NY geography, but cross county, town and village boundaries

-   ***Would not design a system like this from scratch. Hard to change once in place.***

## Cities & villages are urbanized, towns generally not {.smaller}

![](images/image-1554337632.png)

Most towns are small but T. Hempstead almost 800k. Most villages smaller than cities but V. Hempstead is 59k, exploring city option. ([Rockefeller Institute](https://rockinst.org/blog/the-allure-and-challenges-of-becoming-a-city-part-one/))

## Outside NYC, school districts & counties dominate

![](images/image-1382564001.png)

## State-local relationships {.smaller}

-   Local governments are "creatures of the state" (Dillon's rule, Iowa SC, 1868)

-   Home rule - state grants power to local govts to rule themselves

-   NY *ostensibly* allows home rule, but extensive exceptions:

    -   K12 teacher certifications, special education, capital projects

    -   Medicaid financing and eligibility

    -   Wicks law requiring separate bids on public construction rather than GC

    -   Prevailing wage laws governing wages on public construction contracts

    -   Triborough Amendment governing expiring union contracts

    -   Property tax cap and taxation more generally

## What irks local governments?

-   "Mandates" -- Wicks Law, Triborough Amendment, Prevailing Wage Law

-   In this budget

    -   NYSAC - [Steve Acquario testimony](https://www.nysenate.gov/sites/default/files/nys_association_of_counties_23.pdf) -

## Medicaid in New York: A federal-state-local program {.smaller}

-   Federal-state program of health insurance for low-income and medically needy. [CRS](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R43357) and [CBPP](https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/introduction-to-medicaid) primers.

-   Federal government sets the framework, states operate the program, "waivers" of federal rules often allow flexibility

-   Feds cover more than half the cost - larger shares in poorer states.

-   **New York is one of a handful of states that require county governments to pay - about 12% in total.** [KFF financing primer](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-the-basics/). [NYSAC complaint about \$624m 2023-24 budget shuffle](https://www.nysenate.gov/sites/default/files/nys_association_of_counties_23.pdf).

## Medicaid in New York: Support for the needy, and major budget costs {.smaller}

-   [Medicaid covers 7.3 million New Yorkers](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/total-monthly-medicaid-and-chip-enrollment/) (\~36%!) and [46% of births](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/births-financed-by-medicaid)! [FSL spending in NY \$75 billion in 2021](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/total-medicaid-spending). About 75% more per-capita than U.S. average.

-   About [62% of costs are for the elderly and disabled](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-spending-by-enrollment-group/), especially long-term care. [Primary payor for 61% of nursing home residents](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/distribution-of-certified-nursing-facilities-by-primary-payer-source).

-   [Legislative interest in increasing nursing home reimbursement rates by 20%](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2023/01/25/bipartisan-push-begins-for-20--medicaid-increase-to-aid-long-term-care).

-   It is a lifeline for the needy, a budget buster in many yeas, and subject of intense debate.
