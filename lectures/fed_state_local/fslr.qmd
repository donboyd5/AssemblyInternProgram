-   Presentations, part I

-   Lecture: federal, state, local governments

-   Presentations, part II

-   Wrap-up

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
::: notes
The eight 2-minute presenters worked really hard to prepare and made a lot of great points.

Less lecturing by me (less presentation, push more to appendix)

More opportunity for questions/discussion

## Cycle 4 classes (students choose). Possibilities for mine. Comments?

<!-- Students choose classes. My cycle TBD. What's valuable? -->

1.  Deep dive in 3 lectures, one topic: e.g., Education policy/finance in NY, *OR*

2.  Making policy in NY. For one topic:

    -   3 experts (e.g., legislative, executive, advocacy or media), high-level experience in NY

    -   Provide their perspective on making policy in NY

    -   Q&A/discussion with class - substance & strategy, *OR*

3.  A combination of #1 and #2

## The budget - due by February 1 {.smaller}

-   Will use all the oxygen through March or until budget is passed.

    -   SOS proposals will be major issues, of course

    -   Medicaid, always - nursing home reimbursement rates, SOS expansions, growth

    -   K-12 Foundation Aid phase-in: SOS says +\$2.7 billion (13%) - how much will they do?

    -   Issues not directly tied to budget (e.g., minimum wage) may become linked.

-   Tax revenue ahead of plan but recession risk. Debates over amount, policy changes. Gov says no to tax increase on high earners. Some in favor (e.g., [FPI](https://fiscalpolicy.org/fiscal-policy-institute-on-state-of-the-state))

-   Useful: Ways & Means; Senate Finance; [Office of State Comptroller](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/press), [Fiscal Policy Institute](https://fiscalpolicy.org/) (leans left), [Empire Center](https://www.empirecenter.org/) (leans right), [Citizens Budget Commission](https://cbcny.org/) (NYC emphasis). Seek out reactions/analyses from advocacy orgs on your issues.

# [10-minute skill](https://boyd-science.netlify.app)

# 2-minute presentations, first group

-   You are briefing an Assemblyperson, not advocating for a policy

-   What are the most important things you can say at this point?

-   You don't have to know everything (it's early), but try to know what you don't know

# Federal-state-local relationships in New York

## Why even care?

-   Some activities make more sense for one level of government than another

-   Getting things done often requires working with local govts, fed govt (as well as privates and non-profits)

-   Legal constraints and pre-emptions imposed by feds on states, by the state on locals

-   Politics can be complex. Other governments can be both adversaries and cooperators

-   Demographic, economic, and social differences across places affect politics

## Who should do what? Who should pay for it? {.smaller}

-   Who benefits from a policy?

    -   Does the whole nation benefit from an educated populace, or do just the children who are educated benefit, or is it in between? Are there "spillovers"?
    -   What about national defense? City garbage collection?

-   Who can administer a policy effectively? Should the federal government do garbage collection? Should villages collaborate and run the military?

-   Who can finance a policy?

    -   Why do states rely heavily on income taxes but local governments rely heavily on property taxes?

    -   What are some important differences between the two taxes?

-   Which level of government is closest to the people?

## Who does what?

![](images/image-1518810265.png)

## NY spends & taxes a lot more than other states (Medicaid & K-12)

![](images/image-1841803347.png){width="687"}

## Huge regional differences affect needs, wants, capacity, and politics

![](images/image-1609023654.png)

## NYC "gave" 45% of state taxes, "got" 40% of spending

![](images/image-683557828.png)

## 3,100+ local governments - crazy quilt

-   Counties, cities, towns, villages, school districts, ...

-   NYC: a city, county (5 of them), and school district all in one

-   Counties and NYC "exhaust" NY geography, no overlap

-   Towns and cities exhaust county geography, no overlap

-   In the 5 largest cities, school districts are part of the city budget.

-   Elsewhere they are freestanding. Politics of separate budget votes.

## After that, it's the wild west

-   Villages sit within/across towns\
    3 layers (counties/towns/villages) (police in Nassau County)

-   Villages cross town and even county borders - part here, part there

-   School districts exhaust NY geography, but cross county, town and village boundaries

-   ***Would not design a system like this from scratch. Hard to change once in place.***

## Cities & villages urbanized, towns (generally) not

![](images/image-1554337632.png)

## Outside NYC, school districts & counties dominate

![](images/image-1382564001.png)

## State-local relationships {.smaller}

-   Local governments are "creatures of the state" (Dillon's rule, Iowa SC, 1868)

-   Home rule - state grants power to local govts to rule themselves

-   NY ostensibly allows home rule, but extensive exceptions:

    -   K12 teacher certifications, special education, capital projects

    -   Medicaid financing and eligibility

    -   Wicks law requiring separate bids on public construction rather than GC

    -   Prevailing wage laws governing wages on public construction contracts

    -   Triborough Amendment governing expiring union contracts

    -   Property tax cap and taxation more generally

# 2-minute presentations, second group

-   You are briefing an Assemblyperson, not advocating for a policy

-   What are the most important things you can say at this point?

-   You don't have to know everything (it's early), but try to know what you don't know

# Wrap-up

## Next week

-   Next week

    -   Who makes law and policy?

    -   Focus will be on response to litigation, emergency powers

-   Questions/other?
